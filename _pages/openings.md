# Open positions

We are currently looking for new group members  with passion, talent, and grit! 

You will have the chance to work on the grand challenges of condensed matter physics, often at the interface of instrumental design and new physics. You will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, creating and improving instrumental setups, performing measurements, and making discoveries.

If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:milan.allan@gmail.com). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates.

There are some postdoc scholarship available.  I'd be happy to support you after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [veni fellowship](http://www.nwo.nl/en/funding/our-funding-instruments/nwo/innovational-research-incentives-scheme/veni/index.html) or the [Marie Curie fellowship](http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/about-msca/actions/if/index_en.htm). 

If you are a Master student at Leiden University looking for a Master project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office. If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at Leiden University, see [mastersinleiden.nl](http://www.mastersinleiden.nl/programmes/physics/en/introduction).

We are a dynamic research group at the [Bar-Ilan University School of Life Sciences](https://life-sciences.biu.ac.il/en). Our aim is to explore and understand [Diet-Microbiome-Host interactions](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau5812), involving bactreial metabolism, host immunity and post-translational modifications. Specifically, we focus on diseases such as colorectal cancer, obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases and kideny diseases.

To this end, we utlize novel proteomic approaches to study how bacterial metabolism of dietary components affects the bacterial and host proteomes. We want to discover novel mechanisms by which the gut microbiota affects human health and harness them for theraputics (see [Research](research)).

We are located at Bar-Ilan University, where an aspiring cohort of microbiome research groups exists. We exchange ideas and work with our neighbors from [Dr. Nissan Yissachar Lab](https://www.yissacharlab.com/), as well as with the colleagues from Bar-Ilan Medical School - [Prof. Omry Koren](https://www.korenlab.com/) and [Dr. Shai Bell](https://www.thebellab.com/).

 **We are looking for passionate new MSc and PhD students, and Postdocs to join the team** [(more info)]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/openings) **!**


We are grateful for funding from [Bar-Ilan University](https://life-sciences.biu.ac.il/en) and the [Zuckerman Scholars Program](https://zuckerman-scholars.org/ourprograms/faculty/)

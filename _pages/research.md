# Research

The main goal of our lab is to investigate the privacy, and security implications of the technology we use everyday and measures to protect privacy and maintain data integrity. 
We utilize quantitative, qualitative, as well as machine learning methods for our studies.

Some of the topics we are working on are:

** Understanding the behavior of Tor users on Wikipedia, including their contributions as well as the response from Wikipedia itself. We want to understand whether Wikipedia users who want anonymity contribute in the same manner as those who are less concerned with anonymity.


** Using stylometry for the purposes of author verification and applying it to identify sock puppet accounts on social media such as identifying IRA accounts as well as sockpuppets on trading subreddits such as r/wallstreetbets and cryptocurrency subreddits. This research is also applied to identify the risk of deanonymization due to similar writing styles.

** Understanding the landscape of Conspiracy Theories. In April 2022, we have published in ACM's WWW conference [Conspiracy Brokers: Understanding the
Monetization of YouTube Conspiracy
Theories](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.15943.pdf) that studied how conspiracy videos are monetized and the types of advertisements shown.

** Detecting ”Calls to Harassment” and studying harassment communities

** Usability and efficacy of opt-outs for People Search Websites---sites where one can search up people's private information such as addresses and phone numbers. We are also investigating services that claim to remove your information from the internet such as DeleteMe. 

** Intimate Partner Survellance, both the landscape of the communities where users can turn to for help surveilling their partner as well as apps not created for surveillance but can also be used for surveillance.

** Privacy implications and attitudes around distanced learning

** Manipulating Instagram with reciprocity pods

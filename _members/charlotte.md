Charlotte graduated in 2016 with a BA in Cell and Systems Biology from the University of Oxford. Her research involved interrogating the function of a tumour suppressor gene in colorectal cancer.

Subsequently, she worked as a Research Assistant in Professor Bass Hassan’s group at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford. Her projects have included validating a CRISPR-Cas9 approach to target a gene of interest in Ewing’s Sarcoma, and developing a method for diagnosing Ewing’s Sarcoma using liquid biopsies.

Charlotte is now undertaking a PhD in Rahul Roychoudhuri’s lab, studying inhibitory mechanisms that restrict NK cell function within tumours.

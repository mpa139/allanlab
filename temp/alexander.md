His undergraduate research project involved metagenomic sequencing of the human microbiome and has an interest in the application of Omic technologies in research. Alongside his studies, Xan completed internships both in industry, at Kadmon Inc. in New York, and a research-charity, the Wellcome Trust in London. Subsequently, he worked as a research assistant in Professor Ed Bullmore lab at Cambridge University, where he was involved in research on immune function and dysregulation in various psychiatric disorders.

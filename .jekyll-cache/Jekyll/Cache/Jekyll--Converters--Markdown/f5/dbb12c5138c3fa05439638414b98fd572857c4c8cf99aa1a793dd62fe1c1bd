<p>Our main aim is to explore and understand the population adaption and speciation by various methods, such as genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metagenomics. For this, we mainly focus on two study systems.</p>

<p>Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:</p>

<p>â€˜Subterranean miceâ€™ is a general term for a class of small mammals that live underground. There are more than 250 species of underground rats around the world, widely distributed in Asia, Africa, America, and the Europe, living mostly in open areas such as savannas, grasslands, mountains, arid and semi-arid areas, and some of them live in dense thickets and forests.</p>

<p>During the long-term evolutionary process, the subterranean mice have evolved special adaptive evolutionary characteristics, which are of great study significance and application value for researches of biological clock regulation and longevity, hypoxia adaptation and anti-cancer properties.</p>

<p>Some species of  have long lifespans, for example, common squirrels typically live 1-3 years, while blind mole rats can live up to 22 years and naked mole rats can live up to 31 years, which is more than 10 times the lifespan of common squirrels. The mechanism of longevity in ground mice is unknown, and it is speculated that it may be related to variation in the regulation of the biological clock in dark environments.
During the long-term evolutionary process, the subterranean mice have formed special adaptive evolutionary characteristics, which are of great academic significance and application value for the study of biological clock regulation and longevity phenomena, low oxygen adaptation and anti-cancer properties, and are research directions worthy of attention.</p>

<p><strong>Mott physics and high-temperature superconductivity.</strong> Questions of interest include: (i), How does the Mott state collapse upon doping and how is this related to the complex phase diagram of high-temperature superconductors? (ii), What is the strange metal phase seen in correlated electron systems? Is this an exotic long-range entangled state? What is the mechanism of dissipation in that state? (iii), Why is the transition temperature in high-temperature superconductors so high? We have worked on iridates, rhodates, and cuprates.</p>

<p><strong>Nanofabricated â€œSmart Tipsâ€</strong>.

One of theÂ  projects back from my job-proposal is to develop nanofabricated STM tips. The idea behind these â€œsmart tipsâ€ is to use the technologies that were developed over decades in nanofabrication and make them available for scanning probe by using a nano-device instead of the traditional STM tungsten tip. One gains the flexibility of using different functionalities that are known from the fields of nanofabrication and mesoscopic physics. We are collaborating with the group Simon Groeblacher at TU Delft to realize this concept, benefitting from their unparalleled micro/nano fabrication know how.Â  A prototype of a smart tip is shownÂ to the left. See publications in Microsyst Nanoeng, Nanotechnology, and PRB.</p>

<p><strong>Josephson STM.</strong> Josephson STM has the ability to gain insight into spatial variations of the order parameter, or superfluid density. We have managed to, for the first time, use JSTM with atomic resolution on a quantum material.
We have used atomic-resolution Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy to reveal a strongly inhomogeneous superfluid in the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45. The results and their implications are published in Nature.</p>

<p>We also detected and investigated a quite particular YSR state in the same material.</p>

<p><strong>Ultra-stable SI-STM instrument.</strong>  <img src="http://localhost:4000/images/respic/STMHead.png" alt="" style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 10px" />
For SI-STM, having the most stable STM head is key. We have used finite element simulations, good choices in material science, and craftsmanship to build the most stable STM head in the world, to our knowledge. See publication in RSI.</p>

<p><strong>Strange Metals.</strong> The strange metal phase might be the most mysterious phase of high-temperature superconductors. Here, the electrical resistivity grows linearly with temperature T in large areas of the phase diagram, with a mean free path that diminishes to a fraction of the interatomic distance. T-linear resistivity is often associated with quantum critical points and marginal-Fermi-liquid physics. In strange metals, the mystery seems to go even further: we deal with something that looks like a quantum critical phase over an extended range of the phase diagram instead of cumulating in a point. There exists no consistent theory for strange metals, leading to more adventurous new approaches including the holographic theories that use insights from gravity to explain strange metals (a recent textbook on this was written by our colleagues at Leiden University, Schalm and Zaanen).
We are part of the â€˜Strange Metal consortium NLâ€™ that includes the groups of Hussey, Golden, van Heumen, Zaanen, Schalm, Stoof and Vandoren.Â </p>

<p><strong>Magnetic fluctuations and electron spin resonance.</strong>

<p><strong>Twisted bilayer graphene and other material with super-periodicities.</strong>
We have proposed that artificial super-periodicities can lead to improved superconductivity, both because of increased density of states and because of phase space arguments (see image from our SciPost publication below). Perhaps for different reasons, twisted bilayer graphene has been shown to superconduct! We are investigate this material with the groups of Efetov, Baumberger, and van der Molen.</p>

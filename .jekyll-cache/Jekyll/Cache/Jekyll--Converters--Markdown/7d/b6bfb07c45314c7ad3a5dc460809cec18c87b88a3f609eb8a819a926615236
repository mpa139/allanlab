      <pubtit>BIM-based and an Automated Approach for HVAC Troubleshooting</pubtit>
      <p><a href="/projects/bim-based-and"><img src="/images/pubpic/past_prj1.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" /></a>
  <!-- <p>Corrective maintenance (CM) has been and will be the predominant maintenance mode in the US in the near future.  Among these indoor air related ones are require prompt attention because people spend about 90% of their time in buildings in the US (EPA, 1989) and such problems directly affect occupants’ productivity and health (Seppänen et al., 2006). However, investigating indoor air related problems is challenging due to the fact that: Information that is needed for troubleshooting of indoor air problems changes as the characteristics of work orders change; Information required during investigation of indoor air problems reside in discrete data sources; and Existing data sources are not efficient to get insights about a problem in a short time. To deal with these industry problems, the objective of my research is to develop a framework which can enable identification, integration and visualization of the information that is critical for troubleshooting of indoor air problems in spaces served by centralized HVAC systems. The proposed research  brings contributions to the existing body of knowledge in the areas of facility maintenance, BIM, and human computer interaction (HCI). The research will enhance the existing body of knowledge in the FM domain by providing structured mechanisms to help HVAC mechanics to identify critical clues for troubleshooting of indoor air problems. The contribution in relation to BIMs will enable expanding information stored in BIMs with explicit representation of HVAC system functional relationships and clues that HVAC mechanics would need for troubleshooting. The research also contributes to HCI domain in terms of the design, evaluation and generation of visualization-based environments for improving the efficiency of HVAC mechanics while investigating indoor air problems.</p> --></p>

      <pubtit>Delivering Accurate and Complete As-built BIMs: Progressive Laser Scans and As-Planned BIM</pubtit>
      <p><a href="/projects/delivering-accurate-and"><img src="/images/pubpic/past_prj2.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" /></a>
  <!-- <p>' For every construction or renovation project, the general contractor is required to hand over the as-built documents to the owner or the facility management team at the end of the project. The main challenge for the handover process is to ensure the completeness of the captured building information and the accuracy of it in terms of how well it represents the reality. The report published by NIST in 2004 pointed out that $4.8 billion was spent every year just to verify that the captured building information represents accurate building conditions. Laser scanning technology is able to capture accurate geometric information in a timely manner. Hence point cloud data captured by laser scans can be used as the reference to update an as-designed BIM into the as-built BIM. However, two challenges were identified in relation to the process of updating an as-designed BIM into an as-built BIM: a point cloud is a collection of 3D points without any semantic information (e.g., which building component that a point belongs to), hence it is difficult to recognize and extract building components and their associated geometric information from point clouds; and occlusions and construction/renovation progress prevent the laser scanned data captured at a point in time from obtaining a comprehensive view of the building. In order to address these challenges, this research resulted in a framework that supports the update of an as-designed BIM into an as-built BIM by incorporating geometric information captured by progressive laser scans. The framework is composed of three main parts: identifying different types of features that contribute in recognizing the correspondences between a point cloud and an as-designed BIM; evaluating the performance of features for the mapping between a point cloud and an as-designed BIM; and leveraging point clouds captured by progressive laser scans to retrieve a complete view of the building and increase the accuracy of the updated BIM. This framework removes discrepancies between the design model and the actual building conditions, and provide an accurate (i.e., all the building components and their associated geometric information are captured in the as-built BIM) and complete (i.e., geometric information contained in the as-built BIM reflects actual building conditions) as-built BIM as a part of the as-built handover documents.

  <!-- <p>HVAC control design intent is primarily transferred through textual narratives called Sequence of Operations (SOOs).  The current guidelines only define how the information may be presented but do not address to the information requirements of the SOOs.

This research aims to provide a formalized approach to represent the information requirements of SOOs to enable unambiguous representation of HVAC system controls design intent for better building energy control.</p> --></p>

In addition to fatalities, there are many reported and unreported near misses that occur on a daily basis at construction job sites (OSHA 2015). Such problems can only be eliminated if they are proactively identified as risks, and precautions are taken ahead of time for minimization of accidents/incidents.

      <p><a href="/projects/analysis-of-renovation"><img src="/images/pubpic/past_prj12.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" /></a>
  <!-- <p>Renovation projects play a critical role in upgrading the existing infrastructure and preservation of historical landmarks. Challenges in the current renovation projects include the lack of up-to-date facility geometric information that reflects the as-is geometric and spatial information and seamless integration of the proposed renovation projects with the existing parts of facilities. Building Information Modelling (BIM) and laser scanning have been the remedies for these challenges within the current practice.  However, there are still process improvements required for best practices in the implementation of these two technologies. Challenges in the current practice and process improvements have been analyzed in an iconic landmark building facility analyzed in this study. The initial project included one of the largest gothic style cathedrals in North America and a flagship renovation project on its mechanical system. The research team was involved in the mapping of existing facilities, alignment of the proposed systems with existing systems and overcoming the spatial conflicts in implementing the proposed renovation. This research identifies the challenges the construction teams face as they work on aligning the existing systems with the proposed systems, and the lessons learned from the modelling and laser scanning of legacy facilities during ongoing major renovation.</p> --></p>

<p>For high densely populated cities like the New York City, faÃ§ade inspection is a mandatory routine every 5 years for the buildings that have more than 6 floors. The current inspection are mainly based on visual check and the results are based on the inspectorsâ€™ experience. The objectives of this research are (1) to identify the required information for the decision making of faÃ§ade inspection and (2) support the faÃ§ade inspection process with an objective way of detecting faÃ§ade defects using point clouds.<br />

#- title: "Direct evidence for Cooper pairing without a spectral gap in a disordered superconductor above Tc"

#  description: We use our atomic-scale scanning tunneling noise setup on a disordered superconductor, and discover a state above TC that, much like an ordinary metal, has no (pseudo)gap, but carries charge via paired electrons.

- title: "'It Feels Like Whack-a-mole': User Experiences of Data Removal from People Search Websites"
  description: People Search Websites aggregate and publicize users’ Personal Identifiable Information (PII), previously sourced from data brokers. This paper presents a qualitative study of the perceptions and experiences of 18 participants who sought information removal by hiring a removal service or requesting removal from the sites.

- title: "A large-scale characterization of online incitements to harassment across platforms"
  description: Using the incitements or calls to harassment posted by members of these communities as a lens through which to holistically measure and understand this ecosystem. We create a filtering pipeline to discover 14,679 incitements to harassment within four large-scale data sets of messages and posts that span multiple platforms.

This paper investigates how to specify conditions (i.e., a solution concept) for rational cooperation in an environment that also contains Byzantine and obedient peers. We find that regret-free approaches---which, inspired by traditional Byzantine fault tolerance, condition rational cooperation on identifying a strategy that proves a best response regardless of how Byzantine failures occur---are unattainable in many fault-tolerant distributed systems. We suggest an alternative regret-braving approach, in which rational nodes aim to best respond to their expectations regarding Byzantine failures: the chosen strategy guarantees no regret only to the extent that such expectations prove correct. While work on regret-braving solution concepts is just beginning, our preliminary results show that these solution concepts are not subject to the fundamental limitations inherent to regret freedom.",

However, in most cases, interactions with a particular peer or the service itself eventually end, resulting in some last exchange in which departing participants have no incentive to contribute. Without cooperation in the last round, cooperation in any prior round may be unachievable. In this paper, we propose leveraging altruistic participants that simply follow the protocol as given. We show that altruism is a simple, necessary, and sufficient way to incentivize cooperation in a realistic model of a cooperative service's last exchange, in which participants may be Byzantine, altruistic, or rational and network loss is explicitly considered. By focusing on network-level incentives in the last exchange, we believe our approach can be used as the cornerstone for incentivizing cooperation in any cooperative service.",

- title: "Key Grids: A Protocol Family for Assigning Symmetric Keys"
  image: dummy.png
  description: We describe a family of protocols for assigning symmetric keys to processes in a network so that each process can use itsassigned keys to communicate securely with every other process. The k-th protocol in our protocol family, where 1 k logn, assigns O(k2 k n) symmetric keys to each process in the network. (Thus, our (log n)-th protocol assigns O(log2 n) symmetrickeys to each process. This is not far from the lower bound of O(log n) symmetric keys which we show is needed for each processto communicate securely with every other process in the network.) The protocols in our protocol family can be used to assignsymmetric keys to the processes in a sensor network, or ad-hoc or mobile network, where each process has a small memory tostore its assigned keys. We also discuss the vulnerability of our protocols to "collusion". In particular, we show that k ncolluding processes can compromise the security of the k-th protocol in our protocol family.

The k-th protocol in our protocol family, where 1 k logn, assigns O(k2 k n) symmetric keys to each process in the network. (Thus, our (log n)-th protocol assigns O(log2 n) symmetrickeys to each process. This is not far from the lower bound of O(log n) symmetric keys which we show is needed for each processto communicate securely with every other process in the network.) The protocols in our protocol family can be used to assignsymmetric keys to the processes in a sensor network, or ad-hoc or mobile network, where each process has a small memory tostore its assigned keys. We also discuss the vulnerability of our protocols to "collusion". In particular, we show that k ncolluding processes can compromise the security of the k-th protocol in our protocol family.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols}, pages = {178–186}, numpages = {9}, series = {ICNP '06}

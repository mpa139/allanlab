  description: For activity recognition, the traditional methods would omit the whereabouts of the users, i.e. the context. We aim to make use of context information as a guidance to do finer-grained activity recognition. Furthermore, the model is coupled with an uncertainty quantification mechanism to reject unknown context to make sure the prediction is robust

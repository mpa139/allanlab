NeuroErgonomics Lab would like to introduce its newest members: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/umair-iqbal-03b2464a/">Dr. Umair Iqbal</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeevan-jayasuriya-349a952a5/">Jeevan Jayasuriya</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronakmohanty/">Dr. Ronak Mohanty</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kieran-nichols-phd-24134479/">Dr. Kieran Nichols</a>, (order in picture). Dr. Iqbal aims to research fatigue assessment and management, focusing on offshore worker fatigue. Jeevan J. will evaluate the interactive effect of fatigue and altered gravity on sensorimotor and cognitive functions. Dr. Mohanty will contribute to the development of novel multisensory interaction in Extended Reality. Dr. Nichols will focus on evaluating cognitive and motor performance using sensing, cueing, and electrical stimulations. We are excited to build our team as we expand our research in Madison, WI.

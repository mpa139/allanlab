The NeuroErgonomics Lab is thrilled to have been selected by NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration to study #sensorimotor challenges with #fatigue in #AlteredGravity! We look forward to uncovering and characterizing risks associated with #sleep and #cognitive fatigue interactions with #vestibular challenges on astronaut behavioral, functional, and operational outcomes.

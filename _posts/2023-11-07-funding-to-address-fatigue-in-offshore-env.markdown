Our [lab](https://neuroergolab.org/) receives funding from the National Academies Gulf Research Program to develop decision-support tools to address fatigue risks in offshore environments. This work will help to improve the safety of offshore operations by developing a decision-support tool to help offshore workers and managers make better decisions about fatigue risk.

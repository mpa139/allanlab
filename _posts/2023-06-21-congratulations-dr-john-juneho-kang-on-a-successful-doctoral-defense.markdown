Congratulations <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jjkang612/"> Dr. John Kang</a> on a stellar Ph.D. defense! Your <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nasem-gulf-research-program/">NASEM Gulf Research Program</a> work on practical fatigue assessments for offshore safety is impactful and much needed! More so, you have taught everyone at the NeuroErgonomics Lab the meaning of being a true lab mate!

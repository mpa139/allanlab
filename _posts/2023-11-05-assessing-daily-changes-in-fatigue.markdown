The [NeuroErgonomics Lab](https://neuroergolab.org/) is proud to share our latest publication on assessing daily changes in fatigue indicators (using surveys, PVT, HRV, actigraphy) in offshore workers in the GOM over the course of their 28-day hitch! This is one of the largest offshore fatigue studies in the GulfofMexico, supported by the NASEM Gulf Research Program. Congratulations to [Dr. John Kang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jjkang612/) for leading this collaborative effort! Visit  to learn more.

The publication is available at [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2023.104164](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2023.104164).

abstract = {Fatigue in offshore environments is a critical safety hazard, yet the utility of daily fatigue assessments has not been longitudinally examined in these environments. The aim of this exploratory longitudinal field study across two drillships in the Gulf of Mexico was to determine the changes in subjective, performance-based, and physiological fatigue measures over time across different shift types (day, night, and swing) and to identify correlations between these multimodal fatigue assessments. Repeated measures correlation analyses of daily fatigue data from seventy offshore workers revealed that while total sleep time remained unaffected by time on rig, workersâ€™ performances on the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) deteriorated over time across all shift types. Several correlations between the various multimodal measures were consistent with the extant literature on worker fatigue symptoms and perceptual and physiological manifestations. These findings emphasize the utility of PVT and single item self-reports to capture worker fatigue in offshore shiftwork.}
